Task 4 of CodTech Internship: Develop a machine learning classification model using scikit-learn to predict categories based on input features. The model was built using the Iris dataset and evaluated for accuracy. The project was implemented in Python using Pydroid 3 on a mobile phone with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.
# Task 4 – Machine Learning Model using scikit-learn

## 🎯 Objective
Train and test a machine learning classification model using scikit-learn. The goal is to use a built-in dataset (Iris) to classify flower species based on measurements like petal and sepal length and width.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** – Programming language
- **Pydroid 3** – Python IDE on Android phone
- **pandas** – For handling dataset
- **scikit-learn** – For training and evaluating the ML model
- **matplotlib** – (optional) For visualizing results

## 📂 Files Included
- `ml_model_task4.py` – Python script that trains and tests the model
- (Dataset is built-in using `load_iris()` from sklearn)

## ⚙️ Model Details
- Dataset: **Iris Dataset**
- Algorithm: **DecisionTreeClassifier**
- Train/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing
- Accuracy Achieved: ~100%
